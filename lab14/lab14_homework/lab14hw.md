## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

Bachelorâ€™s degree in mathematics, statistics, computer science. Yes, data scientist occupation is growing much faster than average. 

2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 
"Know basic skills in R Studio: simple data analysis, graphing, mapping, and making simple shiny apps. 

3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

I currently interested in doing research in microbiology areas. R skills is significant here, since labs mostly requires data analysis and graphing to support the hypothesis. When writing papers, it is essential to use graphs to make our lab data and results more visual. 

4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

Shiny app is the most challenging part, as it could become extremely complicated, and the syntax can be tricky and chunky, for the fact that is resembles some of what we had learned, but there are also differences. The codes seem to work, but the syntax error really drives me crazy. 

The most rewarding thing is that now I now how important tidyness is for a data set, and for data analysis. We need to get the data ready for R, which is difficult sometimes. How I learned a handful methods of how to deal with untidy data, and most importantly, why this data is not tidy in some cases, and tidy in other sense (pivot longer and wider). 

5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

I wish I know more things about Github, and the way to utilize it. It is a really helpful platform to share, and communicate with other coders. 

6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

I would like to learn more about unix, and more cloud based systems, it is confusing for sure, but I think it will be really helful for further and later studies and researchers, where those skills are actually used instead of R. 

7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to persue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

Yes. In fact, I'm thinking about minor in stats. I found it a pretty interesting and powerful course. I will take more higher division data science courses, and maybe practice doing things in intern or research programs. 

8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

I think it is pretty important. Whenever there is some small issues in my code, I always try to ask my partner first before reaching out to the professor. It is faster. Reversely, when my partner ask me questions, it is a great time for me to be a teacher and check if I truly understand what is going on. 

9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.
The evaluation is not yet available, but I will keep that in mind and complete it once it releases. 

## Push your final code to GitHub!
Please be sure that you check the `keep md` file in the knit preferences.
